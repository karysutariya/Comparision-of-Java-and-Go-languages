# SOEN-6011

Description:
In this project, Standard deviation has been implemented using two different approaches. In the first one, most work
has been done using Iterative approach whereas in second one, around all methods have been written using recursion
approach.

How to execute iterative file:
1. First method:
   This method is based on CMD.
    1. Go inside folder src (Command could "cd src").
    2. run command "javac iterative.java"
    3. run command "java iterative"
2. Second method:
   This one is dependent on Intellij IDE
    1. Open the project in the Intellij
    2. Right click on iterative
    3. Select "Run 'iterative.main()'"
3. Third method:
   This one is dependent on Eclipse IDE
    1. Open the project in the Eclipse
    2. Right click on iterative
    3. Select "Run 'iterative.main()'"

How to execute recursion file:
1. First method:
   This method is based on CMD.
   1. Go inside folder src (Command could "cd src").
   2. run command "javac recursion.java"
   3. run command "java recursion"
2. Second method:
   This one is dependent on Intellij IDE
   1. Open the project in the Intellij
   2. Right click on iterative
   3. Select "Run 'recursion.main()'"
3. Third method:
   This one is dependent on Eclipse IDE
   1. Open the project in the Eclipse
   2. Right click on iterative
   3. Select "Run 'recursion.main()'"
